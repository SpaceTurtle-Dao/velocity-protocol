# VIP-06: Hub Discovery via Gossip Graph

## Summary

This proposal introduces a decentralized discovery mechanism for Velocity hubs using a gossip-based protocol. Each hub maintains a list of other hubs it "follows" and tracks hubs that "follow" it. This bidirectional graph forms the foundation of a self-propagating discovery network that enables resilient and censorship-resistant hub indexing.

## Motivation

Current discovery methods for decentralized nodes often rely on static registries or centralized directories, which introduce fragility and censorship risks. Velocity's design demands a dynamic, decentralized discovery layer. By leveraging a gossip protocol and social-graph-like following behavior, we can enable hubs to discover each other organically, just like people discover others in social networks.

## Specification

### Hub Relationships
- Each hub maintains two lists:
  - **Following**: A list of hubs it actively queries and trusts.
  - **Followers**: A list of hubs that have announced themselves to this hub.

### Reactive Gossip Mechanism
- Hubs do **not** gossip on a timer.
- Instead, gossip is triggered **when a hub receives a message from a hub it follows** (e.g., a profile update, post, or sealed message).
- This ties gossip to real network activity, amplifying relevant and recent connections.

### Gossip Flow
1. **Hub A** receives a message from **Hub B**, which it follows.
2. **Hub A** sends a **GOSSIP** message to its followers, saying:
   - "I just received a message from Hub B. Here’s who B follows."
3. Hub A may push this gossip message to its followers. Those hubs, upon receiving the message, can optionally push it further to their own followers if deemed relevant.

### Gossip Message Structure (ANS-104)

To aid with deduplication, each gossip message must include a `reference-signature` tag pointing to the signature of the original message that triggered the gossip (e.g., a profile update or service announcement).

Example: `["reference-signature", "<original-message-signature>"]`

#### Format Overview
Gossip messages use `kind: 1000` and must follow ANS-104 formatting. Each tag is a `[name, value]` pair. The following are recommended:

**Required Tags:**
- `["hub", "true"]`: Identifies the message as hub-related.
- `["received-from", <hub-id>]`: Public key or identifier of the hub the event originated from.
- `["reference-signature", <signature>]`: Helps uniquely identify the gossiped message for deduplication.

**Recommended Tags:**
- `["referenced-kind", <kind>]`: Optional tag to indicate the kind of message (e.g., `0` for profile update) that triggered the gossip.
- `["following", <hub-id>]`: Repeated per followed hub.
- `["meta", <key>:<value>]`: Useful for declaring type, region, capabilities.
- Profile fields like `["profile-name", <name>]`, `["profile-avatar", <url>]`, `["profile-about", <text>]` help represent identity.

```json
{
  "kind": 1000,
  "tags": [
    ["hub", "true"],
    ["received-from", "hubX"],
    ["reference-signature", "abc123sig"],
    ["profile-name", "Hub X"],
    ["profile-avatar", "https://example.com/avatar.png"],
    ["profile-about", "Indexing hubs in the APAC region"],
    ["following", "hubA"],
    ["following", "hubB"],
    ["meta", "type:indexer"],
    ["meta", "region:APAC"]
  ],
  "data": "Hub X has updated its public profile information.",
  "signature": "..."
}
```

### Query Routing
- Clients initiate discovery queries.
- A client first queries its own hub.
- It may also query hubs that its hub is following.
- Hubs do not forward queries—they only respond to those directly received.

## Use Case: Expressiveness for Specialized Services

While propagating VIP01 (kind: 0) messages is a lightweight approach for identity and basic follow graph sharing, custom gossip messages (kind: 1000) enable greater expressiveness.

### Example: Sealed Message Wrapping Hubs

```json
{
  "kind": 1000,
  "tags": [
    ["hub", "true"],
    ["received-from", "hubSecureWrapX"],
    ["reference-signature", "xyz987sig"],
    ["kind-supported", "10"],
    ["kind-supported", "11"],
    ["fee", "0.01"],
    ["payment", "credit-notice"],
    ["uptime", "99.95"],
    ["region", "NA"]
  ],
  "data": "Wrapper Hub X available for sealed messages.",
  "signature": "..."
}
```

## Benefits
- **Message-Driven Discovery**: Only active and relevant hubs propagate.
- **Fully Decentralized**: No central registries.
- **Resilient**: Discovery persists across partial graph failures.
- **Composable**: Metadata enables semantic filtering.
- **Sybil-Resistant Extensions**: Trust or stake can reinforce legitimacy.

## Considerations

### Gossip Deduplication  
To avoid reprocessing or propagating the same gossip messages multiple times, hubs must deduplicate based on the `["reference-signature", "<signature>"]` tag, which is **required** in all `kind: 1000` gossip messages.

Since gossip messages are ANS-104 data items and are stored persistently, **no additional cache is required**. A hub can simply check whether it has already stored a `kind: 1000` message containing the same `reference-signature`. If it has, the hub may skip processing or re-pushing that message.

Optional additional strategies:
- **Hashed Message ID**: As a fallback, derive a hash from `received-from`, `kind`, and `data`.
- **Time-Based Filtering**: Optionally discard messages older than a freshness threshold.
- **Push Limits**: Track which followers have already received the message to avoid redundant pushing.

## Future Work
- Add reputation scoring and trust models.
- Explore incentive layers for discovery relays.
- Connect this system with sealed message routing mechanisms.
