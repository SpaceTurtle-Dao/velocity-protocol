Reactions
---------

`draft` `optional`

A reaction is a `kind 7` event that is used to react to other events.

The generic reaction, represented by the `Content` set to a `+` string, SHOULD
be interpreted as a "like" or "upvote".

A reaction with `Content` set to `-` SHOULD be interpreted as a "dislike" or
"downvote". It SHOULD NOT be counted as a "like", and MAY be displayed as a
downvote or dislike on a post. A client MAY also choose to tally likes against
dislikes in a reddit-like system of upvotes and downvotes, or display them as
separate tallies.
