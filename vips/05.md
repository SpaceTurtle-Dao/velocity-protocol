Media Attachments
-----------------

Media attachments (images, videos, and other files) may be added to events by including a URL in the event content, along with a matching `url` tag.

`url` ("inline metadata") tags MAY add information about media URLs in the event's content. Each `url` tag SHOULD match a URL in the event content. Clients MAY replace URLs with rich previews.

The `url` tag is variadic, and each entry is a space-delimited key/value pair.

## Tags

```json
{ "name": "Kind", "value": "1" },
{ "name":"Content", "value":"Hello AO https://www.arweave.net/oWdC_5bnlGJ-AETwZuF4zgMefRu3PA2-fR6-NovdZ5k?ext=jpeg"},
{ "name": "url", "value": "https://www.arweave.net/oWdC_5bnlGJ-AETwZuF4zgMefRu3PA2-fR6-NovdZ5k?ext=jpeg" },
{ "name": "mimeType", "value": "image/jpeg" }
```
* `url` the url to download the file
* `mimeType` a string indicating the data type of the file. The [MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types) format must be used, and they should be lowercase.
* `size` (optional) size of file in bytes
* `dim` (optional) size of file in pixels in the form `<width>x<height>`
* `magnet` (optional) URI to magnet file
* `i` (optional) torrent infohash
* `blurhash`(optional) the [blurhash](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash) to show while the file is being loaded by the client
* `thumb` (optional) url of thumbnail with same aspect ratio

## Recommended client behavior

When uploading files during a new post, clients MAY include this metadata
after the file is uploaded and included in the post.

When pasting URLs during post composition, the client MAY download the file
and add this metadata before the post is sent.

The client MAY ignore `url` tags that do not match the URL in the event content.
