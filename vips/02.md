Follow List
-----------

`final` `optional`

A message with kind `3`, meaning "follow list" is defined as having a `p` tag, a list of public keys, one for each of the profiles one is following.

Each entry should contain the public key for the profile,

The `content` is not used.

For example:

```json
{
    "Kind": "3",
    "name": "p",
    "value": [array of public keys],
}
```

Every new following list that gets published overwrites the past ones, so it should contain all entries. Relays and clients SHOULD delete past following lists as soon as they receive a new one.

Whenever new follows are added to an existing list, clients SHOULD append them to the end of the list, so they are stored in chronological order.
