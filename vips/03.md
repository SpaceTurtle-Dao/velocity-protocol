Text messages and Threads
----------------------

`draft` `optional`

This VIP defines `kind:1` as a simple plaintext message.

## Tags

The `.content` property contains some human-readable text. 

```json
{ "name": "Kind", "value": "1" },
{ "name": "marker", "value": "reply" },
{ "name": "e", "value": "Id of the event being replied to" },
{ "name":"Content", "value":"Hello AO"}
```

`<marker>` is optional and if present is one of `"reply"`, `"repost"`, `"root"`.

Markup languages such as markdown and HTML SHOULD NOT be used. 

## Marked "e" tags (PREFERRED)

Kind 1 events with `e` tags are replies to other kind 1 events. The `e` tag MUST contain the event ID being replied to.

For threaded conversations:
- `marker="reply"`: Direct reply to a specific message
- `marker="root"`: References the root message of a thread

Multiple `e` tags MAY be used to reference both root and parent messages.

### Example Thread Structure
```json
// Root message
{ "Kind": "1", "Content": "What's your favorite AO feature?" }

// Direct reply  
{ "Kind": "1", "Content": "I love the message system!", "e": "<root_id>", "marker": "reply" }
```

Kind 1 replies MUST NOT be used to reply to other kinds

## Marked "p" tags (PREFERRED)
Kind 1 events with `p` tags mention specific users. The `p` tag SHOULD contain the public key of the mentioned user. This allows clients to notify mentioned users and create social connections.

## Marked "p" tags (PREFERRED)
Kind 1 events with `p` tags are repost of other kind 1 events. Kind 1 repost MUST NOT be used to repost other kinds
