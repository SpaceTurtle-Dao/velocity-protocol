`draft` `optional`

This VIP defines `kind:1` as a simple plaintext message.

## Tags

The `.content` property contains some human-readable text. 

```json
{ "name": "Kind", "value": "1" },
{ "name": "marker", "value": "reply" },
{ "name": "e", "value": "Id of the event being replied to" },
{ "name":"Content", "value":"Hello AO"}
```

`<marker>` is optional and if present is one of `"reply"`, `"repost"`, `"root"`.

Markup languages such as markdown and HTML SHOULD NOT be used. 

## Marked "e" tags (PREFERRED)

Kind 1 events with `e` tags are replies to other kind 1 events. Kind 1 replies MUST NOT be used to reply to other kinds

## Marked "p" tags (PREFERRED)
Kind 1 events with `p` tags are repost of other kind 1 events. Kind 1 repost MUST NOT be used to repost other kinds
