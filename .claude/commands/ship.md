# Ship - Enhanced CI-Guaranteed Pre-GitHub Push Workflow

Orchestrates a comprehensive 6-phase development workflow with auto-fix capabilities before pushing to GitHub. **Guarantees CI success** by running exact CI commands locally, automatically fixing common issues, and providing complete validation with recovery mechanisms.

## Workflow Overview

Executes a comprehensive 6-phase approach to prepare code for GitHub push with automatic fixing:

### Phase 0: 🔧 PRE-FLIGHT AUTO-FIX

**Automatic resolution of common issues**

- Stage untracked files that should be included
- Run `npm run format` to auto-fix formatting and basic ESLint issues
- Remove common debug logging patterns
- Validate git state and suggest corrections

### Phase 1: 🧹 CLEANUP

**Comprehensive codebase health assessment**

Executes `/cleanup` command to:

- Map architecture and identify inconsistencies
- Detect and remove dead code and unused imports
- Analyze legacy patterns and outdated implementations
- Audit documentation accuracy
- Optimize test suite health
- Clean configuration and environment setup
- Assess code quality and identify technical debt
- Generate prioritized action plan for improvements

### Phase 2: 🧪 TDD

**Test-driven development validation**

Executes `/tdd` command to:

- Discover and analyze existing test coverage
- Identify critical testing gaps
- Generate test scaffolding for untested code
- Assess test quality and patterns
- Execute complete test suite with coverage
- Generate testing metrics and reports
- Optimize test infrastructure
- Create systematic testing improvement plan

### Phase 3: 🚀 PREPUSH

**Pre-push validation and CI simulation**

Executes `/prepush` command to:

- Validate git state and branch readiness
- Ensure clean dependency installation (npm ci)
- Run **EXACT CI COMMANDS**: `npm run format:check && npm run type-check && npm test && npm run audit`
- Remove debug logging statements
- Execute build verification
- Run complete test suite with coverage
- Perform security audit and dependency scanning
- Validate performance metrics
- Generate final push readiness assessment

### Phase 4: 🔄 AUTO-RECOVERY

**Automatic issue resolution where possible**

- Auto-fix formatting issues: `npm run format`
- Stage corrected files automatically
- Retry failed validations after fixes
- Report unfixable issues with specific guidance

### Phase 5: ✅ FINAL VALIDATION

**CI-identical verification and push confidence**

- Run complete CI simulation: `npm run ci:quality`
- Generate confidence score (0-100%)
- Provide specific fix commands for any remaining issues
- Create ready-to-execute push commands

## Mode-Specific Behavior

### Quick Mode (`/ship quick`)

- **Duration**: ~3-5 minutes
- **Focus**: Essential validation with auto-fix
- **Phases**: Pre-flight auto-fix + Prepush + Auto-recovery
- **Auto-Fix**: ✅ Formatting, basic ESLint, git staging
- **Use Case**: Rapid iteration, small changes, hotfixes

### Full Mode (`/ship` or `/ship full`)

- **Duration**: ~8-15 minutes
- **Focus**: Comprehensive quality assurance with auto-fix
- **Phases**: All six phases (pre-flight → cleanup → tdd → prepush → auto-recovery → final validation)
- **Auto-Fix**: ✅ All automatic fixes + comprehensive validation
- **Use Case**: Feature completion, major changes, releases

### Analysis Mode (`/ship analysis`)

- **Duration**: ~5-8 minutes
- **Focus**: Code quality and test analysis with suggestions
- **Phases**: Pre-flight + Cleanup + TDD (no build/push validation)

## Integration Points

### Git Hook Compatibility

- Works with existing pre-push hook
- Complements automated debug log removal
- Provides additional validation layers
- Can be configured as optional pre-push validation

### CI/CD Alignment

- Mirrors GitHub Actions pipeline locally
- Prevents common CI failures (linting, tests, build)
- Validates exact dependency installation (npm ci)
- Tests performance and security metrics

### Project-Specific Optimizations

- Leverages existing package.json scripts
- Uses project's Vitest configuration
- Respects TypeScript strict mode settings
- Maintains AO message and MCP server patterns

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Cleanup Phase Failures

- **Action**: Continue with warnings, create TODO tasks
- **Impact**: Code quality improvements deferred
- **Recovery**: Address high-priority items identified

### TDD Phase Failures

- **Action**: Report coverage gaps, continue to prepush
- **Impact**: Test coverage below thresholds
- **Recovery**: Create test generation tasks

### Prepush Phase Failures

- **Action**: Stop workflow, provide specific fixes
- **Impact**: Not ready for GitHub push
- **Recovery**: Fix critical issues, re-run workflow

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Execution

- Run compatible checks simultaneously
- Cache dependency installation
- Reuse build artifacts where possible
- Stream output for immediate feedback

### Incremental Validation

- Skip unchanged areas when possible
- Use git diff to identify scope
- Cache test results for unchanged files
- Optimize based on change impact

## Best Practices

### Before Running

- Ensure working directory is clean or changes are staged
- Verify you're on the correct branch
- Confirm remote branch is up to date
- Review any large changes manually

### During Execution

- Monitor output for critical issues
- Be prepared to address failures interactively
- Keep terminal window visible for progress
- Don't interrupt unless absolutely necessary

### After Completion

- Review all suggested improvements
- Prioritize critical and high-impact items
- Create follow-up tasks for deferred improvements
- Document any manual fixes applied

## Integration with Existing Commands

### Standalone Usage

- `/cleanup` - For code quality analysis only
- `/tdd` - For test coverage validation only
- `/prepush` - For pre-push validation only
- `/epcc` - For structured feature development

### Combined Workflows

- `/prime` + `/ship` - Full context + complete validation
- `/visual` + `/ship` - UI development + validation
- `/ship` + git push - Complete deployment workflow

## Success Criteria
